# Tyler Carter

Seattle-based data analyst and automation-focused developer. I work on turning messy data and text-heavy inputs into useful analysis, clear reports, and tools that remove manual effort.

My background is in delivery and operations, and my current work is hands-on data analysis and automation. I use Python and SQL for most of my work and rely on AI-assisted tools when they clearly simplify text-heavy tasks like classification, triage, or summarization.

## What I work on

- Data cleaning, analysis, and reporting using Python and SQL  
- Automated reporting pipelines and KPI dashboards  
- Text analysis and classification workflows, using AI where it adds value  
- Internal tools that replace recurring manual steps  

## Featured project

### RAG Issue Triage Copilot
A portfolio sandbox that demonstrates automated issue triage for GitHub and Jira. It ingests issue data, retrieves similar historical context, and proposes classifications with a human-in-the-loop approval flow. The project uses a production-style setup with background workers, persistence, and CI/CD.
